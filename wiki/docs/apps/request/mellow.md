## Create Bot

Go to this website: https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ and press `new Application`. Copy the Client ID first, you will need that later.
After you have done that go to the Settings Tab to the left and select Bot and press `Add Bot`. You can now copy the Token from the Bot which you will
need for the Mellow Configuration later on.

## Invite Bot

Before your Bot actually listen to the channels on your server you will have to invite it first. I recommend using this for beginners: https://discordapi.com/permissions.html
Select the Permissions from below and paste the Client ID down there which you copied earlier. After that just click the link on the bottom and you will
be redirect to a new page where you can select the server you want to invite the Bot too.
